      <description>Welcome to a site constructed in order to keep me accountable for learning Data Science and sharing my path, with all of its struggles and hopefully benefits with the world. It is also a place for me to keep an informal portfolio of different projects that I am working on and share that with people who may be interested.
Goals &amp;amp; Plan Generally the plan of this site is to post at least once a week, if not more often about whatever I am currently working on.</description>

      <description>Afflictive Emotions Quiz My friend Matt Gola had this idea to create a quiz that would diagnose which of the 6 root and 22 subsidiary kleshas (mental afflictions) a user suffered from and give some advice in accordance with the Dharma. I thought that this was a great idea since it could be a great application of machine learning to psychological health and as far as we know, nothing like this has ever been done before.</description>
