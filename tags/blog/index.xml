      <description>Welcome to a site constructed in order to keep me accountable for learning Data Science and sharing my path, with all of its struggles and hopefully benefits with the world. It is also a place for me to keep an informal portfolio of different projects that I am working on and share that with people who may be interested.
Goals &amp;amp; Plan Generally the plan of this site is to post at least once a week, if not more often about whatever I am currently working on.</description>
